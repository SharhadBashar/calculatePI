# CalculatePI
Calculates the value of PI
Steps:
1. Draw a circle of radius 1 centered in a square of sides 2
2. Randomly put dots in the square. Some will fall inside the circle, some wont
3. Calculate the distance of the dots from the center of the circle. If the distance is less than 1, they are inside the circle, if not, they are outside.
4. PI = 4*(dots in the circle/total number of dots)
